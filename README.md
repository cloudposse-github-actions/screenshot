This GitHub Action will use Puppeteer to generate screenshots from any URL or even a `file://`. It's great for creating dynamic banners for GitHub projects.

## Screenshots


![Demo](docs/example.png)
*<br/>Example of running a screenshot generated by this action from the [`test/html`](test/html) HTML.*


## Introduction

This action generates a screenshot of any website (including file://) using Puppeteer.



## Usage



For a complete working example that generated the demo image, see the [`.github/workflows/test.yaml`](.github/workflows/test.yaml) workflow.

```yaml
name: Generate Screenshot

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  screenshot:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    concurrency:
    group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}
    cancel-in-progress: true

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Run this composite action
      id: screenshot
      uses: cloudposse-github-actions/screenshot@v0
      with:
        url: "file://${{github.workspace}}/test/html/index.html"
        output: "docs/example.png"
        
        # Overwrite any CSS
        css: |
          body {
            background: rgb(2,0,36);
            background: linear-gradient(139deg, rgba(2,0,36,1) 0%, rgba(9,9,121,1) 56%, rgba(147,0,255,1) 100%);
          }

        # Replace any text using JQuery-style CSS path selectors" 
        customizations: |
          "#name": "${{ github.event.repository.name }}"        

        # Set the width & height of the viewport
        viewportWidth: 800
        viewportHeight: 600
 ```

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|---------|----------|
| consoleOutputEnabled | consoleOutputEnabled | true | false |
| css | Custom CSS overrides | N/A | false |
| customizations | String representation of a YAML or JSON map of CSS paths (key) and replacement (value) | N/A | false |
| deviceScaleFactor | Specifies the device scale factor (pixel ratio) for the web page rendering. It determines how many physical pixels are used to represent a single logical pixel. For example, a device scale factor of 2 means one logical pixel is represented by two physical pixels, commonly used for high-DPI (Retina) displays. A value of 1 uses standard pixel density. This factor affects the resolution and quality of the rendered page or screenshot. | 2 | false |
| fullPage | Screen capture the entire page by scrolling down | false | false |
| imageQuality | Quality of the output image (1-100, applicable for JPEG) | N/A | false |
| omitBackground | Omit the browser default background. Enable to support transparency. | true | false |
| output | Output image file path | screenshot.png | false |
| outputType | Output image type | png | false |
| url | URL of the HTML content to convert to an image. Use file:// for local files | N/A | true |
| viewportHeight | Viewport height in pixels | N/A | true |
| viewportWidth | Viewport width in pixels | N/A | true |
| waitForTimeout | Number of miliseconds to delay before taking screenshot | 500 | false |


## Outputs
